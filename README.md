# OpenWeatherMap Web Data Connector

Sign up for the [Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api) before getting started.

To get started with the web data connector you will want to make sure you have python installed on your computer or node.js. These give you access to the python and node web servers, which you will use to server the web data connector.

You won't need the Web Data Connector SDK to run your connector, but you will need it to extend the work we have done or trouble shoot our code if you run into issues.
